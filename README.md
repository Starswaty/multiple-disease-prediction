## Introduction

The "Multiple Disease Prediction" project is a web-based tool that empowers individuals to anticipate potential health concerns by predicting the likelihood of heart disease, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. By harnessing machine learning models, this tool allows users to make informed decisions and take preventive measures to enhance their well-being.

### Why it exists

In a world where prevention is often more effective than treatment, this project exists to provide individuals with the ability to anticipate and mitigate future health challenges.

### How it helps

This tool serves as a powerful means of self-assessment, allowing individuals to gain insight into their future health prospects. By predicting multiple diseases, it empowers users to take proactive steps to enhance their well-being.

## Models

### Heart Disease Prediction Model

This section describes the machine learning model used for predicting heart disease.

### Diabetes Prediction Model

This section describes the machine learning model used for predicting diabetes.

### Parkinson's Disease Prediction Model

This section describes the machine learning model used for predicting Parkinson's disease.

## Streamlit App

The project includes a Streamlit web application that provides an interactive interface for users to input their data and obtain predictions for multiple diseases.
